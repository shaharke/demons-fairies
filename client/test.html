        Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheet. Script adds all styles it needs for
        presentation to work.
        
        This style below contains styles only for demo presentation. Browse it to see how impress.js
        classes are used to style presentation steps, or how to apply fallback styles, but I don't want
        you to use them directly in your presentation.
        
        Be creative, build your own. We don't really want all impress.js presentations to look the same,
        do we?
        
        When creating your own presentation get rid of this file. Start from scratch, it's fun!

                    Sure, everybody loves The Beatles, Led Zeppelin
                    and Pink Floyd, <em>BUT</em> the famous names of the
                    era are just the tip of the musical iceberg.
                    There were more, way more simply amazing
                    bands which just didnâ€™t make it big.
